## Overview
Tech to Tech Hub, in collaboration with Flavor Fields, developed an innovative recipe recommendation system called **Data Crunch**. This application provides personalized recipe suggestions based on the ingredients users have at their disposal, catering to various dietary preferences and meal categories.

## Problem Statement
Many people face the challenge of having various ingredients in their kitchen but struggle to decide what to cook. This leads to either time-consuming meal preparation or the need to purchase additional ingredients. The overwhelming number of recipe options can make meal planning daunting. **Data Crunch** addresses these challenges by offering personalized recipe suggestions, reducing food waste, and simplifying meal planning.

## Objectives
1. **Main Objective:** Develop an interactive, user-friendly recommender system that provides personalized recipe suggestions based on user-input ingredients.
2. **Recipe Matching:** Implement an algorithm that matches user-input ingredients with a comprehensive recipe database to offer tailored recipe suggestions.
3. **User Interface and Experience Design:** Create an intuitive and user-friendly interface allowing users to easily browse recipes, read reviews, and receive personalized suggestions.

## Datasets
We utilized two main datasets for this project:
1. **Recipe Review and User Feedback Dataset (from UCI):** This dataset includes details such as recipe number, recipe name, user information (ID, name, reputation), review details (created at, reply count, thumbs up/down, stars, best score), and comment text.
2. **Ingredients Dataset (from Kaggle):** This dataset includes recipe names, ingredients lists, and cooking instructions.

## Methodology
### CRISP-DM Process
1. **Business Understanding:** Defined the project's goals and objectives.
2. **Data Understanding:** Analyzed the datasets to understand their structure and content.
3. **Data Preparation:** Cleaned and preprocessed the data to make it suitable for modeling.
4. **Modeling:** Experimented with several models, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), to develop the recommendation system.
5. **Evaluation:** The models were evaluated based on their performance, with the Tuned SVD Model being the best-performing model.
6. **Deployment:** Deployed the model using Streamlit to create an interactive web application.

### Key Results
- The **Tuned SVD Model** had the best performance, with a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 1.5374 and a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.0629.
- The system suggests recipes based on predicted ratings and user input, allowing users to select their preferred recipes and receive cooking instructions.

## User Interface and Deployment
The **Data Crunch** web application was built using Streamlit, providing a user-friendly interface for users to input ingredients and receive recipe recommendations. The app was deployed using Streamlit Community Cloud, enabling easy collaboration and sharing.

## Recommendations for Future Work
- **Recipe Categorization:** Develop a robust categorization system that classifies recipes based on cuisines, ingredients, cooking methods, and dietary preferences. Incorporate a diverse range of cuisines to cater to a broad audience.
- **Automated Sentiment Analysis:** Implement automated sentiment analysis to analyze user feedback in real-time. Use NLP techniques to extract insights from reviews and adjust recommendations accordingly.


## Conclusion
The **Data Crunch** system successfully provides personalized recipe recommendations, simplifying the meal planning process and enhancing the cooking experience.
